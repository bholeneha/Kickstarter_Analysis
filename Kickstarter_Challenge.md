# An Analysis of Kickstarter Crowdfunding Data to Determine a Campaign Strategy. 

## Overview 

Louise is an up and coming playwright who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play *Fever*. She has estimated a budget over 10,000 dollars. She is interested to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Success of crowdfunding campaigns may depend on many factors, quantitative and qualitative both. In this analysis, we are doing a quantitative analysis of the data obtained from Kickstarter, to help Louise determine her campaign strategy.

### Purpose

The purpose of the project is to analyze crowdfunding data obtained from Kickstarter to give Louise insights on how goal ranges and launch dates correlate to the outcomes of the campaigns. 

## Analysis and Challenges

The [Kickstarter data set](Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx) used in this analysis contains 4114 records on campaigns launched from 2009 to 2017. The data set was loaded and processed in Excel. The first analysis was done to determine correlation, if any, between outcomes and the launch dates of the campaigns. The second analysis was done to determine the correlation between the outcomes and goals of a campaign. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The table shows May and June have the highest number for successful campaigns. This is visually evident in the graph as well. The graph shows the ratio of successful to failed compaigns is also highest in May and June, almost double the successful campaigns than failed campaigns. Additionally, it can also be concluded that the ratio of successful campaigns to failed campaigns is lowest in the months of October to December than the rest of the year. 

To conclude, the chances of a theatre campaign being successful is highest in May and June.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This graph shows the percentage of successful campaigns in the range of the goal amounts. It is evident from the graph that certain ranges have higher percentage of successful campaigns. The goal amount upto 5000 dollars is most likely to be successful than higher goal amounts. Additionally, the range of 35,000 dollars to 45,000 dollars also appears to have a higher ratio of sucessful campaigns, however, the total number of campaigns conducted in this range is significantly low as evident in the table (total of 9 campaigns). This makes the data in this region of the graph insignificant to this study.   

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

This data set contained several outliers that were skewing the data. Additionally, only the data from January and February was available for the year 2017, which would also affect the calculations as well as the graphs for the analysis done based on Launch date. 
However, the data set for the year 2017 has data for only the months of January and February, making the data set is incomplete. Therefore, the data for 2017 can be disregarded from the data set.

However, with or without taking 2017 in consideration, the month of May and June have relatively more successful campaigns than failed campaigns. 

## Results

We found that the outcomes of the campaign do have a correlation with the launch dates of the respective campaigns as well as with the goal amount of the campaigns.  

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Campaigns that started in May and June were relatively more successful than those launched in other months. Campaigns that started in the October and till end of the year, were the least successful campaigns throughout the year. Therefore, campaigns starting in May and June have higher chances of being successful. Loiuse should consider starting her campaign in May or June. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Additionally, campaigns with goal amounts under 5000 dollars are more likely to be successful than campaigns with higher goal amounts. Therefore, Louise should consider keeping her goal amounts under 5000 dollars.  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

A table of showing ratios of successful to failed campaigns can also be useful to create graphs to visually depict a graph. 

### Limitations

This analysis was conducted on data set from a single website, Kickstarter. However, quantitative analysis using data from various different crowdfunding websites may result in more insightful and reliable conclusion. Moreover, using qualitative data in addition with quantitative data might also reveal more well rounded insights into determining factors involved in making campaign successful.
